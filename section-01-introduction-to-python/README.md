# Introduction

## Introduction to Computer Science

Now that you've gone through the Fundamentals, Front-end and Back-end modules, it's time to add the Computer Science module to your knowledge!

Check out the steps we will follow during this module:

1. Let's start by venturing into yet another programming language! We will study Python in the Computer Science module.

2. Then we will study how algorithms work, they are classified and how we talk about their qualities and performance. We'll see some examples of sorting and searching and we'll study strategies to solve all kinds of challenges!

3. Last but not least, we will study a `repertoire of classical data structures`. Data structures are like building blocks for our algorithms, helping us build solutions quickly and with quality.
