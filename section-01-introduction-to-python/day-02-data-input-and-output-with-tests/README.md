# Learning Python

Today, we're going to learn how to structure a `Python` project, also adding a new element to our programs. We will learn how to add input and output data and how to manipulate some types of files, such as `CSV` and `JSON`, which allow us to persist data, in addition to testing our programs in an automated way.
