# Exercise 02

## Field Validator

- Create an npm project from scratch
- Install [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the library we will use: [validator.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)
- Structure an HTML page with a form
- The form must have: a field to insert the text to be validated, a dropdown to select which validation should be done, a button to execute the validation and a text that informs if the value is valid or not
- Do at least five validations using the `validator` library. Enjoy and check out the documentation to see exactly how to use it!
- Run your application using vite
- Test if your application is approved by [Trybe lint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-trybe-frontend)
