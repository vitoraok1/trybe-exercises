## Asynchronous JavaScript

What are we going to learn?

It is very common that we need to make external requests or deal with some browser resource. To perform these tasks you will need to use asynchronous code and the most common way of dealing with asynchronous code in Javascript is using Promises. They are a powerful feature of the language, and because of that, they are widely used.

The fetch method itself, which is one of the contents we will see today, also uses promises to make external requests.

Mastering asynchronous code will give you another important tool to become a developer person, so let's take a few more steps on your journey together.
