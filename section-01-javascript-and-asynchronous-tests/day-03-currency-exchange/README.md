## Practice - Currency Exchange

What are we going to learn?

Today the class will be focused on the practice of what we have learned so far. We will provide a repository with exercises that should be developed throughout the day. The idea is to practice so you gain familiarity with creating a development environment and the concepts of promises and fetch api. Later, at the time of the live class, the exercise will be implemented together with the instructional team of your class.
