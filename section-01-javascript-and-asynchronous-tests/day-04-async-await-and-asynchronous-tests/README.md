## Async, await and asynchronous tests

What are we going to learn?

You have already learned how to handle asynchronous requests using .then(). Today you will learn another way to do this, using async/await. We will also show you how to handle possible errors in our asynchronous requests, using the try/catch block.

In addition, you will learn how to use async/await to perform tests that have asynchronous requests.
