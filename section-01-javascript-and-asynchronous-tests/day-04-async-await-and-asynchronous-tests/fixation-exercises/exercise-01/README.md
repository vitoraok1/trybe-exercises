# Exercise 01

## Handling errors

In the application we built, are we going to handle the error differently? Instead of printing the message in console.log, use the [Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) library to show users more beautiful error messages! For that:

- Install the library using the terminal;
- Handle the error using the library alert
- Try passing an invalid zip code ðŸ˜Ž
