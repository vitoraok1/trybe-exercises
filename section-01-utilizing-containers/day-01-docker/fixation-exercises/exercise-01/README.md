# Docker fixation exercise

## Exercise 01

In (Docker Hub)[https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image], using the search box (`"Search for great content"`), search for the `Debian` Linux Distribution image.

## Exercise 02

Once you find the **official image**, access it (by clicking on your card) and check it on the details page. Check if there is any command to download the image locally without having to create a `container` for it.

## Exercise 03

Download the image using the `tag`: `stable-slim`, which is a stripped-down version of the distribution.

## Exercise 04

After downloading the image to your local computer, create and run a `container` in interactive mode using this image as a reference â€” don't forget to reference the `tag`.

## Exercise 05

In the terminal, you should be able to run the `cat /etc/*-release` command, which will return data from the `Debian` distribution being run inside the `container`.

## Exercise 06 

Shut down the terminal.

## Exercise 07

Check your list of containers which `container` refers to the exercise you just practiced.

## Exercise 08

Start the same `container` **again**, without creating another one. Validate that it is active in the container list.

## Exercise 09

Return to the `container` that was created earlier in this exercise.

## Exercise 10

Run the command `cat /etc/debian_version` which should return the current system version of the `container`.

## Exercise 11

Shut down the terminal.

## Execise 12

Remove only the `container` created for this exercise.

## Exercise 13

Create and run interactively in 'Cleanup' mode, the `andrius/ascii-patro`l.

## Exercise 14

Close the `container` using the buttons `ctrl` + `c`
