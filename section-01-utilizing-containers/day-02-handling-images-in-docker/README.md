# Manipulating and Creating Images in Docker

## What are we going to learn?

Before we continue with learning about Docker, let's remember everything we learned in the previous content?

- Application packaging;
- What are the problems that **Docker** proposes to solve;
- **Docker** architecture aspects;
- Main commands for using **Docker**;
- How to run images from **Docker** Hub (official **Docker** image repository).

Now, the time has come to deepen our knowledge of **Docker**!üêã

Today, we are going to understand the purpose of each **Docker** command, its usage and its relationships. And there's more! We will also create Docker images for our applications using industry standards and best practices.
