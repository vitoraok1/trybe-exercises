# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

`Sorting algorithms` are part of a category of algorithms that seek to place elements of a sequence in a certain defined order. This order can be numerical, lexicographical or by any other characteristic. The reasons for ordering a sequence can range from being easy to see to being easy to search.

`Search algorithms`, on the other hand, look for an item with a certain property within a collection, and this collection can be generated element by element, from a series of operations (mathematical formula, procedure), not requiring a collection in fact. These algorithms should not only be associated with arrays. Algorithms in this category are those that traverse data structures in order to find a value.
