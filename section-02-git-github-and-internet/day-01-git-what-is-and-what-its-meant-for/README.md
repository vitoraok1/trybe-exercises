## Creating a repository

Chegou a hora de praticar os seus conhecimentos sobre o Git!

Para isso, vocÃª vai criar um novo diretÃ³rio no seu computador e realizar algumas modificaÃ§Ãµes ðŸ¤©

- Create a folder on your computer;

- Access the folder you just created;

- Start versioning with the git init command;

- Open the folder in VSCode with the command code .;

- Create a file called README.md;

- Add the new staging file and commit. For example: git add . and git commit -m "Describe the change you made";

- Create a new branch with the command git checkout -b. For example: git checkout -b add-readme;

- Make a change in README.me and go back to the main branch and merge the changes with the command git merge branch-name. For example: git merge add-readme.

- Now that you've created the folder and merged the changes, let's go ahead and create new branches!

- Access the main branch and create a new branch called update-readme;
Go to the update-readme branch and create a file called infos.txt;

- Add staging changes and commit;

- Add your first and last name in the infos.txt file;

- Re-add the staging changes and commit;

- Create a new branch from the update-readme branch. The new branch should be called add-infos;

- Access the add-infos branch and use your creativity to write a step-by-step guide on how versioning works in README.md. For example: "The first step is to have a versioned folder and create an initial structure and we do that using the git init command. The second step is to create a new branch with the command git checkout branch-name or git checkout -b name -da-branch", etc. You can also use this time to write and answer any questions you still have about versioning.

- Add changes in staging, commit;

- Go back to the update-readme branch and merge the changes made in the add-infos branch;

- Return to the main branch and merge the changes.
