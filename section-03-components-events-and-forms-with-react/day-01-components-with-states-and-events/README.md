## Introduction

What are we going to learn?

Today is dedicated to practicing even more your knowledge of **React Components** and deepening it with the concept of *State*. This is an important concept that you will delve into for as long as you study React!

A state represents a moment of a dynamic component. If your component is a clock, its *current state* is the current time. If your component is a table whose contents change according to what the user clicks on the page, its state contains the contents of the table. If your component were a video game, the state would be the time you are in the game, your amount of lives, your ammo, your items, etc. State is, then, a *moment* of something *that can change over time (dynamic)*. It's **information** you want to preserve while the component is interacting with its users.

Did you find it confusing?! Today's class will simplify these concepts! This will be the first step in understanding a very important tool for your career. Also, let's see how we add the famous events that we already use so much in J*avaScript* in our React components.
