# POO in Python

An Object-Oriented code is born with a longer lifetime than non-oriented codes. This form of programming, called `Object Oriented Programming (O.P.O.)` is one of the most popular.

Programming languages ​​such as Java, Python, C++, Ruby and the classic Smalltalk are strongly geared towards object-oriented work. Even languages ​​like JavaScript, which do not fully embrace the paradigm, are heavily influenced by P.O.O, classes in JavaScript are an example.

More than a way to organize code, Object Oriented Programming is a way of thinking. It underlies some of the application architectures that we have already studied, in addition to many others that may appear in our professional lives.
