# Node and Linked Lists

The **Nodes** **are an Abstract Type of Data**. The node is small, elementary and, when used alone, not of much use, but it is from which several other very powerful TADs are built. One of them is the linked list!

**Linked lists** **offer some important advantages over other linear data structures**. Unlike arrays, `LinkedLists` are a dynamic data structure, resizable at runtime. Furthermore, insertion and deletion operations are efficient and easily implemented.

Linked lists are also the basic building blocks of other structures such as Stack and Queue. In addition, they have mechanics similar to those of graphs, trees, dynamic memory allocation, among other applications. It is a linear data structure and can help a lot in understanding non-linear data structures like trees, and can also help identify complexities.
