# Exercise 01

## Now the practice

*To carry out the proposed exercises for the day, we will use the employees table from the hr database. The database can be generated and restored using this [SQL file](https://lms-assets.betrybe.com/lms/hr.sql).*

1. Write a query that displays the highest salary from the table.

2. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays the difference between the highest and lowest salary.

3. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays the average salary of each `job_id`, sorting by average salary in descending order.

4. Write a query that displays the amount of money needed to pay all employees.

5. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays four pieces of information: the highest salary, the lowest salary, the sum of all salaries and the average salary. All values â€‹â€‹must be formatted to have only two decimal places.

6. Write a query that displays the number of people who work as programmers (`it_prog`).

7. Write a query that displays the amount of money needed to pay each job (`job_id`).

8. Using the previous query, make changes so that only the amount of money needed to cover the payroll of programmers (`it_prog`) is displayed.

9. Write a query that displays in descending order the average salary of all jobs except programmers (`it_prog`).

10. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays average salary and the number of employees for all departments with more than ten employees. Hint: group by `department_id`.

11. ðŸš€ Write a query that updates the `phone_number` column so that all phones starting with `515` should now start with `777`.

12. Write a query that only displays information for employees whose first name is eight or more characters long.

13. Write a query that displays the following information for each employee: `id`, `first name` and `year hired` (display only the year).

14. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays the following information for each employee: `id`, `first name` and `day of month hired` (display only the day).

15. Write a query that displays the following information for each employee: `id`, `first name` and `month hired` (display only the month).

16. Write a query that displays the employee names in capital letters.

17. Write a query that displays the last name and hire date of all employees hired in July 1987.

18. ðŸš€ Write a query that displays the following information for each employee: `name`, `surname`, `time working at the company` (in days).
