## Introduction

In today's class you will learn a fundamental concept to build your applications in *React*! 

Every React component has a `Lifecycle`, or **lifecycle of a component**, in the context of the application's interaction with each browser. The phases of this `Lifecycle` have functions associated with them, through which the programmer can associate behaviors. For example, the `componentDidMount` function runs as soon as a component has just been mounted in the DOM. A logic to be executed at that exact moment must be called there.

So it's time to learn more about `Lifecycle` and the various moments with which you interact through React's own functions.

Let's learn how to use the component's lifecycle methods so that we can program everything in its proper place.
