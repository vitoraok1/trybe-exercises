## Pokédex - React Router

Today's challenge is to enhance a Pokédex application using React Router. You will have access to a repository with a working React application, where a card with information about a Pokémon is displayed and a button to navigate between a list of Pokémon. You can also filter by specific types.

In addition to these features that already exist, you'll have to add new routes to the application, so that you can view more information about each Pokémon and even bookmark the Pokémon you like the most.
