# Hashmaps and Dict

Hashmap is a key-value data structure that allows us to input and locate the person's record in `O(1)`! This structure is very powerful and, therefore, is widely used in computing. For this reason, it is also highly demanded in interviews that require the resolution of algorithmic problems (whiteboard interviews), especially in large companies.
