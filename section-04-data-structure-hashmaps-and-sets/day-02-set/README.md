# Set

In sets, it is important to understand the operations that are performed on some data, so that we can recognize when the data is behaving as a set. That way, when we recognize that the data is behaving as a set, we can make use of the language's default implementation, avoiding implementing features that already exist.

Many real-world entities, and computational problems, can be modeled as sets. In the content we will see some case studies to understand this better. In addition to these scenarios, we will see in the exercises how we can use sets to help us know if we have seen an element before and how to eliminate duplicate elements, for example.
