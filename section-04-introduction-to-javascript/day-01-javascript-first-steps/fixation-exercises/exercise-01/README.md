## Based on the introduction about variables used in JavaScript, do the following exercises:

- Create a constant called myName and give it its name (Example: Carolina).
- Create a constant called birthCity and assign it to your hometown.
- Create a let variable called birthYear and assign it the year you were born.
- Use console.log() to print the constants and variables you created.
- Change the value assigned to the birthYear variable to 2030. Do a console.log(birthYear) again to see what happens!
- Change the value assigned to the birthCity constant. Do a console.log(birthCity) again! Could you explain why we get an error message?
