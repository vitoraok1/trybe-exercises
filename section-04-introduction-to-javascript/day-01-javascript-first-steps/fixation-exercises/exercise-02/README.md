## Based on what you learned about basic JavaScript arithmetic operators, let's do some simple operations to find the area and perimeter of a rectangle with base 5 and height 8.

- Create a constant called base and assign it the value 5.
- Create a constant called height and assign it the value 8.
- Create a constant called area and assign to it the result of multiplying the base by the height. Tip: remember to always use console.log() to print variables and check the results of operations!
- Create a constant called perimeter and assign it the sum of all sides of the rectangle.
