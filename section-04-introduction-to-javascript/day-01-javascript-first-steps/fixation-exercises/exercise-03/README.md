# :rocket: To consolidate

## Based on what you learned about `if/else` conditional structures do the following exercises:

- Create a constant that receives the grade of a candidate in a technical challenge, and assigns it a value between 1 and 100;
- Implement a logic that checks if the candidate has passed, failed, or if that person is on the waiting list. To do this, consider the following information:
- If the grade is greater than or equal to 80, print “Congratulations, you were approved!”
- If the grade is less than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, print “You are on our waiting list”
- If the grade is less than 60, print “You failed”
- Create a conditional structure using `if, else if and else` to create your algorithm, and the logical operators that apply to each situation.
- Change the grade value to verify that the conditions you implemented work.
