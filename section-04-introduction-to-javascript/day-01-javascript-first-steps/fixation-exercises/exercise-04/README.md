# To consolidate

## Using the AND operator `&&`, do the following exercises:

- Create a constant called “currentHour”, which receives a number between 4 and 24 of your choice, to represent the hours of the day.
- Create a variable called “message” which is initially an empty string.
- Implement conditionals so that:
    - If the time is greater than or equal to 22, enter “We shouldn't eat anything, it's bedtime” in the “message” variable.
    - If the time is greater than or equal to 18 and less than 22, enter “Rango da noite, let's have dinner :D” in the variable “message”.
    - If the time is greater than or equal to 2 pm and less than 6 pm, enter “Shall we make a cake for breakfast?” in the “message” variable.
    - If the time is between 11 am and 2 pm, enter “Lunch time!!!” in the “message” variable.
    - If the time is between 4 and 11, enter “Hmmm, smell of freshly brewed coffee” in the “message” variable.
- Now print the `message` variable outside of its conditions.
