# To consolidate

## Using the OR operator `||` do the following exercises:

- Create a variable called “weekDay” that receives the string “Wednesday”.
- Using `if/else`, implement conditionals so that:
    - If our “weekDay” variable is “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday” or “Friday”, print “Oba, another day of learning at Trybe > :D”.
    - If it's a weekend day, print "FINALLY, well deserved rest UwU".
