# To consolidate

## Using the `switch/case` structure, do the following exercises:

- Create a variable to store the candidate's status in the selection process, which can be: `'approved'`, `'list'` or `'rejected'`;
- Create a conditional structure with `switch/case` that will print the following messages:
    - If `'approved'`, print “Congratulations, you've been approved!”.
    - If `'list'`, print “You are on our waiting list”.
    - If `'failed'`, print “You failed”.
    - If `default`, print the message “Incorrect information”.
