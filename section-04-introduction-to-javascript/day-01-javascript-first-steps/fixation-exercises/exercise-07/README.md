## To consolidate

- Make five programs, one for each basic arithmetic operation. Your program must have two constants, `a` and `b`, defined at the beginning with the values ​​to be operated on. Make programs for:
    - Addition (a + b)
    - Subtraction (a - b)
    - Multiplication (a * b)
    - Division (a / b)
    - Module (a % b)
