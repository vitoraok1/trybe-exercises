## To consolidate

- Use `if/else` to make a program that defines three constants with the values ​​of the three interior angles of a triangle. Return `true` if the angles represent the angles of a triangle and `false` otherwise. If any angle is invalid, the program should return an error message.
    - For the angles to be a valid triangle, the sum of the three must be 180 degrees.
    - An angle will be considered invalid if it does not have a positive value.
