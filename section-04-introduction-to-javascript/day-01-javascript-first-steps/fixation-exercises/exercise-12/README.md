## To consolidate

- Use `switch/case` to make a program that receives the name of a chess piece and returns the moves it makes.
    - As a challenge, make the program work both if it receives the name of a part with capital letters or with lowercase letters, without increasing the number of conditionals.
    - As a hint, you can search for a function that makes a string all lower case (lower case).
    - If the passed part is invalid, the program must return an error message.
    - Example: `bishop` (bishop) -> `diagonals` (diagonals)
