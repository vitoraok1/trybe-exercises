## To consolidate

- Use `if/else` to make a program that converts a grade given in percentage (from 0 to 100) into grades A to F. Follow these rules:
    - Percentage >= 90 -> A
    - Percentage >= 80 -> B=
    - Percentage >= 70 -> C
    - Percentage >= 60 -> D
    - Percentage >= 50 -> E
    - Percentage < 50 -> F
    - The program should return an error message and terminate if the grade passed is less than 0 or greater than 100.
