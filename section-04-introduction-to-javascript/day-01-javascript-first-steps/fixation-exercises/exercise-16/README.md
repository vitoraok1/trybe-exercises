- Use if/else to write a program that starts with two values ​​in two different constants: the cost of a product and its sales value. From the values, calculate how much profit (sales value, discounting the cost of the product) the company will have when selling 1,000 of these products.
    - Please note that the cost of the product is subject to a tax of 20%.
    - Your program should also issue an error message and terminate if any of your input values ​​are less than zero.
    - The profit of a product is the result of subtracting the sale value by the cost of the same, and the 20% tax is also part of the cost value.
        -TotalCostValue = CostValue + TaxOnCost;
        - profit = salesValue - TotalCostValue (profit from a product);
