## :rocket: Handling Arrays

We will use this array to perform the next exercises.

```
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
```

- Go through the array printing all the values ​​contained in it with the `console.log()` function;
- Add all the values ​​contained in the array and print the result;
- Calculate and print the arithmetic mean of the values ​​contained in the array;
    - The arithmetic mean is the result of the sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
- Based on the code you just generated, make it so that, if the final value is greater than 20, print the message: “value greater than 20”. If not, print the message: “value less than or equal to 20”;
- Using `for`, find the largest value contained in the array and print it;
- Find out how many odd values ​​there are in the array and print the result. If there is none, print the message: “no odd value found”;
- Using `for`, find the smallest value contained in the array and print it;
- Using `for`, create an array that goes from 1 to 25 and print the result;
- Using the array you just created, print the result of dividing each of the elements by `2`.
