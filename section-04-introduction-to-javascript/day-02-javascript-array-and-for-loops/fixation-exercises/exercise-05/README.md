## Bonus - Bubble Sort Sort

```
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
```
- Sort the `numbers` array in ascending order and print its values;
- Sort the `numbers` array in descending order and print its values;
- Now create a new array from the `numbers` array, without losing it. Each value in the new array must be equal to the corresponding value in the `numbers` array multiplied by the next. For example: the first value of the new array should be 45, as it is the multiplication of 5 (first value) and 9 (next value). The second value of the new array should be 27, as it is the multiplication of 9 (second value) and 3 (next value), and so on. If there is no next value, the multiplication must be done by 2. Do this using `for` and the `push` method.
