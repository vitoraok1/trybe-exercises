# What are we going to learn?

In this part you will learn about algorithms and programming logic, the basis of everything we will do from now on.

As in a cake recipe, in programming we must, step by step, use commands to solve a problem. This sequence of commands is called an algorithm. To create an algorithm, we have to develop an analytical capacity to transform large problems into small, logical commands. We developed this way of reasoning with programming logic.

## You will be able to:

- Breaking big problems into small ones;

- Use programming logic to solve problems.
