- The factorial is the multiplication of a natural number by its predecessors, except zero. For example:

```
O fatorial é representado pelo sinal !
4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
```

Based on this information, create an algorithm that prints the factorial of 10 on the screen.

Use the `for` repetition structure to develop an algorithm that is capable of inverting a word. For example, the word “banana” would be inverted to “ananab”. Use the string below as an example, then change it to others to check if your algorithm is working correctly.

```
let word = 'tryber';
```

- Consider the array of strings below:

```
let array = ['java', 'javascript', 'python', 'html', 'css'];
```

- Use the `for` repetition structure to write two algorithms: one that returns the largest word in this array and another that returns the smallest. Consider the number of characters in each word.
- A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has only two divisors, that is, it is divisible by 1 and itself. Knowing this, write an algorithm that returns the largest prime number between 2 and 50.
