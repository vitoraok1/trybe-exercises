## Exercise 02

In the example above, we use `for/of` to loop through our iterable and return the value of the indices.

Now that you know the difference between them and how to use them, let's practice?

- Using the object below, use `for/in` and print the message `'Hello xxxxx'` to the console for each name, replacing the `xxxxx` with the name in question.

```
let names = {
  person1: 'Jo√£o',
  person2: 'Maria',
  person3: 'Jorge',
};
```
