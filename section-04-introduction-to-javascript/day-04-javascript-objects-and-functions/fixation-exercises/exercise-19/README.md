## Exercise 19

- Create a function called arrayOfNumbers that will receive the vector variable as a parameter.

- Through a for loop, go through this variable, look for the even numbers and add them to a new array, which should be returned at the end by the function.

```
let vector = [[1, 2], [3,4,5,6], [7,8,9,10]];
```
