# Exercise 02

## Simpsons Exercise

1. Create a function that reads all data from the file and prints each character in `id - Name` format. For example: `1 - Homer Simpson`.

2. Create a function that receives the `id` of a character as a parameter and returns a `Promise` that is resolved with the data of the character that has the `id` informed. If there is no character with the informed `id`, reject the Promise with the reason “id not found”.

3. Create a function that changes the `simpsons.json` file removing the characters with `id` 10 and 6.

4. Create a function that reads the `simpsons.json` file and creates a new file, called `simpsonFamily.json`, containing the characters with `id` from 1 to 4.

5. Create a function that adds the character `Nelson Muntz` to the `simpsonFamily.json` file.

6. Create a function that replaces the character `Nelson Muntz` with the character `Maggie Simpson` in the `simpsonFamily.json` file.
