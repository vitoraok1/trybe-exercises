## Introduction

Automated tests are a fundamental part of any quality software, and React is no different. Over the next few days, we'll learn how to use `react-testing-library`, remembering that there are also other testing libraries.

Therefore, today you will learn how to **write automated tests in React!** Furthermore, you will learn how to use the tools that `react-testing-library` offers to test entire components and behaviors, simulating the occurrence of events and dealing with asynchronous logic.

All of this will, of course, be accompanied by a discussion of what good testing practices are and what the tradeoffs of different testing approaches are.
