# Exercise 02

## Bonus

- Add a date picker JavaScript library to the form you built in the last class. Use this library in the “Date” field, responsible for receiving the date chosen for the trip in the form. As the library will be used to validate the dates chosen by the user, remove the previously used date validations and apply the library validations. Remember that, by selecting the type of input through the type, you are also creating a form of validation.
    - Suggestions: [DatePickerX](https://github.com/AvroraTeam/DatePickerX) or [Pikaday](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday).
    - **spoiler-alert**: Reading documentation may seem complex at first, but it's extremely normal if you experience any difficulties. Some libraries will have a more direct way of displaying the information, as is the case with `DatePickerX`, which we indicated above. Others tend to be more detailed and require a little more attention when reading, which may seem more difficult at first, like `Pikaday`, which we also recommend. We suggest that you read both documentations and choose the one whose usage you understand best. And don't worry, reading documentation will be part of your developer routine, and experience along with practice makes everything more intuitive and simple.

- Add a JavaScript library of validations to the form you built in the last class. Use this library to override the validations you did manually.
