# ORM and Authentication

## What are we going to learn?

We already know that back-end applications communicate with the database frequently. Now, it's time to make this process easier by learning about ORM (`Object-Relational Mapping`)! The ORM provides a way to alter and interact with a database through JavaScript code. From it, it is possible to create and change tables, perform queries, insert and extract data from the database, all this just by writing JavaScript code.
