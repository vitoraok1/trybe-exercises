# Exercise 04  

Create an HTML page that has a click count.

In addition to the basic HTML structure, your page must have:

- A tag that will receive the updated value of the number of clicks on the button.
- A button with the text `click here!`, which will receive an *event listener* of type click;

In the `script` structure (inside the HTML or in a JavaScript file):

- Create a `clickCount` variable that will accumulate the number of button clicks;
- Create the event logic, so that at each click on the button, the variable is updated by adding a value of 1. Example: If no click has been performed, the value rendered will be `0`. If the button is clicked 5 times the value rendered in the HTML will be `5`.
