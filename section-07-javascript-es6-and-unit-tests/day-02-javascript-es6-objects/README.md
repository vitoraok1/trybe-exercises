## Introduction - JavaScript ES6

What are we going to learn?

Today you will learn a little about exception flow, that is, how to handle errors in your code using the `throw` and `try/catch` methods. Also, you will see some functions that interact with **objects**. These methods will help you a lot when you need some reading of your values ​​or keys, or when you need to copy them. This is a very important step towards the good and more advanced use of **JavaScript**. Objects are very present in all **ES6** logic. The methods we will see are:

- `Object.keys`;

- `Object.entries`;

- `Object.assign`;

- `Object.values`.
