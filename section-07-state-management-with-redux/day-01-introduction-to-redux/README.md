## What is Redux?

*Redux* is a global state management library that can be used with any front-end *framework* or with pure JavaScript.

With *Redux* you can have a global state for your application. And, once this state is defined, you will be able to read and write the information from anywhere (or any component, in the case of using *Redux* with React).

The reading and writing tasks in the global state are done in a well-structured way, that is, *Redux* defines a “recipe” that must be followed. For this reason, *Redux* is considered an “*opinionated*” library (translation of opinionated, which means that the library has well-defined rules for how to work).
