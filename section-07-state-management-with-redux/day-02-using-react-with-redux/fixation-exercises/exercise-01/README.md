# Exercise 01

## Creating the Store and Provider

The character Seiya, from the famous Japanese animation Knights of the Zodiac, needs your help to accumulate cosmo (energy) and defeat his opponent.

The code below presents an application developed in React with Redux. However, she is broken. The percentage of cosmo accumulated by Seiya must be stored in the application's global state, but the *Store* has not yet been created.

Your objective in this exercise will be:

- Implement the application's *Store*, which is found in the `./src/redux/index.js file`;
- Implement the application's Provider, passing the created *store* as prop. To do so, make the necessary changes to the `./src/index.js file`.

For the completion of this exercise, you only need to change the *store* and index.js files mentioned above. But feel free to explore the entire application.
