# Exercise 02

## Creating Reducer and Action Creator

Have you ever watched the movie The Matrix? At a certain point, two pills are offered to Neo, the protagonist of the film, who must choose only one.

The application below allows you to do the same, that is, choose one of the pills. But, when you click on one of them, your application breaks!

Your challenge in this exercise will be:

- Implement the action creator, which is found in the `./src/redux/actions/index.js` file;
- Implement the reducer, which is found in the `./src/redux/reducers/pillChoice.js` file.

You can complete the challenge just by deploying the files mentioned above, but feel free to explore all the application files.
