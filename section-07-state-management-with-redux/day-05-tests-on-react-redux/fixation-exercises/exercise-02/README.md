# Exercise 02

## Pokémon Card

To understand a little about asynchronous tests, we are going to use **Pokémon Card**, which is an application made with React that uses Redux for state management and makes requests to an API to display information related to a certain Pokémon. View the application code by accessing [this repository](https://github.com/tryber/exercise-pokemon-card).

This application uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to access the name and image of a randomly chosen Pokémon. Once the page is loaded, a Pokémon's information is displayed. To discover another Pokémon, just click on the [Pokéball](https://pokepedia.fandom.com/pt/wiki/Pokeb%C3%B3la) displayed on the screen.

To see the application running, you can `git clone` the [repository](https://github.com/tryber/exercise-pokemon-card) or access the [application's deploy](https://exercise-pokemon-card.surge.sh/).
