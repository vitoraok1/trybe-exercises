# JavaScript ES6

What are we going to learn?

We will learn the concepts and applications of the so-called `Higher Order Functions`, as well as understand how we can benefit from this valuable resource when building code.

These functions are quite powerful, and we can use them to implement solutions for different types of situations, resulting in a more readable, concise and expressive code.
