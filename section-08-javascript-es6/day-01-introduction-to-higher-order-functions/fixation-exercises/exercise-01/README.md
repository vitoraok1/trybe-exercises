# Exercise 01

## To consolidate

Let's practice with the following exercises:

  - Create a function that returns the string `'Waking Up!!'`;

  - Create another function that returns the string `'Let's have coffee!!'`;

  - Create one more function that returns the string `'Gone to sleep!!`';

  - Now develop a *HOF* called `doingThings` and configure this function to print to the console the result of executing the functions you created in the previous examples. Example:

```
// When calling the doingThings function:
doingThings(wakeUp);

// It must return the value of the respective parameter, in this case:
// Waking up!!
```
