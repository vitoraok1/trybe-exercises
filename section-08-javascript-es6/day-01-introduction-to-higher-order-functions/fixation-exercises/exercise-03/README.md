# Exercise 03

## Lottery draw

Develop a *HOF* that returns the result of a draw. This *HOF* will generate a random number between 1 and 5 taking as parameters the number bet and a function that checks if the number bet is equal to the number drawn. The return of your HOF must be a string (Ex: “Try again” or “Congratulations you won”).
