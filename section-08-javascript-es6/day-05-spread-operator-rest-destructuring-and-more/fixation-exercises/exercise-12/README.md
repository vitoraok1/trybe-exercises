# Exercise 12

## Now the practice

- Suppose you are dealing with cars, and as the problem was handed to you, each car is represented within an array. Then your boss asks you to change the format from array to object. Create a `toObject` function that, given a list, returns an object representing the car:

```
const palio = ['Palio', 'Fiat', 2019];
const shelbyCobra = ['Shelby Cobra', 'Ford', 1963];
const chiron = ['Chiron', 'Bugatti', 2016];

// escreva toObject abaixo
```
