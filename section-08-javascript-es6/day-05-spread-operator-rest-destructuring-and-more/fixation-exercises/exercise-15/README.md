# Exercise 15

## Now the practice

- There is a `yearSeasons` object that represents the seasons. Each season is a key of this object, and the value of each key is an array of strings, representing the months of that season. From this object, unstructure the seasons and spread them out in an array of months of the year.

```
const yearSeasons = {
  spring: ['March', 'April', 'May'],
  summer: ['June', 'July', 'August'],
  autumn: ['September', 'October', 'November'],
  winter: ['December', 'January', 'February'],
};
// yearSeasons: estações do ano.
```
