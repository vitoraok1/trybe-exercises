# Introduction to TypeScript

## What are we going to learn?

Today you will take the first steps towards learning about what **TypeScript** is, how to use it and why it has become increasingly relevant in the world of programming.

Today's content and the rest of the days in this section will be entirely dedicated to getting to know this programming language, but it's just the beginning. A language has many features and tools and one section would not be enough to cover everything, so rest assured, this is just an introduction to TypeScript and over the next few sections you will continue to learn about it. ðŸ˜‰

However, if you'd like to take a deeper look, feel free to consult the documentation. It's pretty cool and objective and you can even use the TypeScript Playground to test all the examples you see there in a very simple and practical way!
