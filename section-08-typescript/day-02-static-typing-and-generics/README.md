# Introduction to Generics

## What are we going to learn?

In a programming career, more time is spent interacting with other people's code than writing new code. Therefore, using functions written by other people is a relevant part of programming!

But how can we use someone else's function with **the types we've created** while maintaining all the security that typing introduces?

Today we're going to learn two important concepts for TypeScript and other statically typed languages: *Generics* and *Type Assertion*! You will understand the importance of both and the best time to use them in your code. In addition, you'll apply them to use ready-made functions with any types you want and create your own functions for any types!
