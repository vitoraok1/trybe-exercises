# TrybeTravel

Today, our exercise will be to create an API that will be responsible for managing a travel agency. We will use the Sequelize ORM to manage the database and its relationships and we will implement our RESTful API using the MSC layered architecture, with TypeScript, in addition to creating authenticated routes with JWT.
