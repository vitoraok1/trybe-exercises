# Transactions API

Today, our exercise will be to develop unit and integration tests for an API that manages financial transactions of different types. We will use the test setup composed by the Mocha, Chai and Sinon tools to test the behaviors of some features of our API, taking into account even if the routes that we will test are protected or not by authentication.
