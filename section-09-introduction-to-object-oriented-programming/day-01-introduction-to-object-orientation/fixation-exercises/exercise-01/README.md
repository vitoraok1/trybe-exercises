# Exercise 01

## Now the practice

### Exercise 1:
Let's model some parts of a school's software. Write a class whose objects will represent people students enrolled in a course. Each object of this class must contain the following data: enrollment, name, 4 test notes, 2 work notes.

### Exercise 2:
Now let's add behaviors to our person-student class. To this add two methods: one that calculates the sum of the student person's grades and another that calculates the average of the student person's grades.

### Exercise 3:
Let's change our context a little to a cafeteria sales system. Create a class that represents a diner customer, a class that represents an order, and a class that represents an order item.

  - The customer person must contain the name;
  - The order item must contain the name of the order (eg “French fries”; “Açaí”) and the price;
  - The order must contain the customer, the items consumed, the payment method (ex: "card", "cash") and the percentage in decimal of - discount for the order (ex: 0.1 for 10%, 0.3 for 30% ), the order may or may not have a discount.

### Exercise 4:
Now let's add the behaviors to our classes from the previous exercise. The class that represents the order must have two methods: one that calculates the order total and another that calculates the total by applying the discount amount.

### Exercise 5:
 Write a Date class whose instance represents a date. This class should contain three attributes: the day, the month and the year.

### Exercise 6:
Let's add behaviors to our Date class from the previous exercise. This class should contain the following methods:


- constructor: must check if the date passed by parameter is a valid date, if not, create a date with value “01/01/1900”;
- getMonthName: returns the month of the date in full;
- isLeapYear: returns true if the year is a leap year and false if not;
- compare: receives as a parameter another object of the Date class, compares it with the current date and returns:
  - 0 if the dates are the same;
  - 1 if the current date is later than the parameter date;
  - -1 if the parameter date is after the current date.
- format: receives as a parameter a day, month and year format and returns the formatted date.
  - Subtitle:
    - yyyy = four-digit year
    - yy = two-digit year
    - mm = month with 2 digits
    - M = full month
    - dd = day with 2 digits
    - Examples:
      - "dd/mm/yyyy" = 01/01/1900
      - “yyyy-mm-dd” = 1900-01-01
      - “dd of M of yy” = January 1, 90
      - "dd, M of yyyy" = 01, January 1990
