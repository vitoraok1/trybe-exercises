# Inheritance and composition

We saw, in the last class, how the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm works based on the concept of objects, entities that we can create, and the messages that they can exchange with each other.

Today, we're going to add more important OOP features to our toolbox that will allow us to create code that is more organized, less likely to make mistakes, and easier to maintain, use, and reuse in the future!

We will, in short, talk a lot about sharing logic between classes, creating specialized versions of classes based on both inheritance and the implementation of an interface.
