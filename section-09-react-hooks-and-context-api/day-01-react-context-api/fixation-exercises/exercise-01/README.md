# Exercise 01

## To Consolidate

Create a React application and implement a form containing the personal data of a Trybe student. Your components need to be functional and, for state management, they need to use `hooks`.

The form must contain:

  - Input of type text containing the complete name;
  - Input of type number containing the age;
  - Input of type text containing the city;
  - Four radio button inputs containing the module you are studying (Fundamentals, Front-end, Back-end or Computer Science);
  - A button to submit information. In this exercise you don't need to implement the click, the button should just exist in the application.
