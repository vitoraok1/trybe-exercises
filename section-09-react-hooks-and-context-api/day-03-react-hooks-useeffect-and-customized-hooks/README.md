# Introduction 

What are we going to learn?

You've already learned about some `hooks` that are provided by React itself, such as `useState` and `useContext`. In today's class, you'll learn how to create your own custom `hooks`! This will make your code cleaner and more readable as you will be able to reuse the same block of code across multiple components. In addition, you can use different Hooks made available by other developers.
