# Exercise 01

## Adding clear input function

In the application below, we are using the `useFormInput` Custom Hook. Its return is an object containing the keys `value` and `onChange`. We need to add one more feature: to clear the `input` fields as soon as the form is submitted.

For that:

  - Add this functionality directly to the Custom Hook;
  - Adjust the `App` component to use this new functionality to clear form fields.
