# Exercise 02

## Application Manager

In this repository, you can find a working React application that simulates, in a very simplified way, a candidate management system. In this application, it is possible to view the candidates through an API and approve or reject each one of them.

The purpose of this exercise is for you to refactor this application, for that you will need to create customizable hooks to refactor the already implemented code, making it cleaner and more organized

Access the [Application Manager exercise repository](https://github.com/tryber/applicant-manager), and read the README for more detailed instructions on how to perform each exercise.
